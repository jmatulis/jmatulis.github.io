                <h3>Technological Literacy – Infrastructure & Support</h3>
                <p>One of my primary goals was to deepen my technical understanding of enterprise-level IT provisioning and asset management.

I updated my team on my work during regular scheduled stand up meetings. I practiced writing and updating documentation and knowledge base articles in my teams OneNote, I worked on the our CoopDeploy OneNote adding documentation of the structure of our internal website.</p>
    
                <h3>Critical Thinking – Web Platform Enhancement</h3>
                <p>In addition to provisioning, I worked on improving the internal asset tracking website built with React and Node.js. My goal was to improve the quality-of-life of a Provisioning Specialist using CoopDeploy. I refined my problem-solving skills by adding new UI components, and implementing a model mismatch check feature to improve asset tracking and consistency.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This work term at The Co-operators allowed me to bridge my academic learning with real-world IT operations. I developed practical knowledge of enterprise provisioning, software deployment, and technical support while contributing meaningfully to internal tooling through web development.

I look forward to applying these experiences in future terms and long-term career development.</p>
