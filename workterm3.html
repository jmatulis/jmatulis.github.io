                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <h3>Critical & Creative Thinking - Creativity</h3>
                <p>My goal was to enhance my creativity through the development of novel live streaming user interfaces. This involved experimenting with interactive features like switchable native chat, private chat, and tabbed navigation for fans. Positive feedback from the team and users validated the effectiveness of these features, and the entire process was documented for future reference.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Understanding - Intercultural Competence</h3>
                <p>I aimed to deepen my understanding of global K-pop fandoms and how to use technology to foster a sense of community. My research into fan dynamics and Korean culture influenced the platform’s design, with features like live fan translations during streams, which enhanced the platform's global appeal. The insights gained were documented in a detailed report on K-pop live streaming platforms.</p>
                
                <h3>Critical & Creative Thinking - Inquiry & Analysis</h3>
                <p>Another goal was to strengthen my understanding of frontend technologies such as React and Node.js. By implementing key features like real-time chat and an interactive schedule for streams, I improved my technical proficiency and received positive feedback from my peers. This collaborative effort was documented in a technical report for future developers.</p>
