            <h3>Jonas Matulis - 1194815 - jmatulis@uoguelph.ca</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the documentation of my four-month co-op work term experience. 
                As you explore this website, I hope you'll gain insight into my experience, and
                the objectives I pursued, and the skills I acquired in the realm of STEM education for children.</p>

            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>Ontario Tech University's (OTU) Faculty of Engineering and Physical Science, formerly known as the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) since its inception in 2002, stands among Ontario's premier engineering schools. By 2021, OTU educated about 10,100 undergraduates and 970 graduates, boasting over 25,500 alumni by 2022.

                In 2014, the faculty embarked on a mission to introduce Kindergarten to Grade 12 students in the Durham Region to engineering through its 'Engineering Outreach' initiative. Within four years, this initiative expanded, engaging over 24,000 students annually. Their core aim is to ignite curiosity in the youth, equipping them to tackle real-world challenges using STEM disciplines, benefiting not only Durham but its neighboring communities.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
                <h3>Goal 1: Oral Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Improving my STEM presentation skills was both rewarding and tough. I realized my nervousness and speed created difficulty for students to understand. 

Mock presentations were key. The feedback helped improve my tone and storytelling. This boosted my confidence and clarity. I found analogies to be great for simplifying topics and creating a more engaging presentation.

Over my work term, I have become more comfortable presenting especially when explaining STEM concepts. I have much more room to improve, but overall I am happy with how my public speaking has improved over the summer!

                </p>
                <h3>Goal 2: Creativity in STEM Education</h3>
                <p>
                    During my work term, I had the chance to bring my own creative ideas to life for various camps and workshops. This was especially crucial for the virtual sessions planned for the summer. Designing engaging and understandable STEM activities posed a unique challenge.

                    One of the most challenging tasks was crafting a virtual camp for children aged 6 to 8. I had to devise activities they could do independently, pushing me to think creatively. A standout activity was the "future phone" session. Here, campers learned about phone technology and its potential future before designing their own phone model using cardboard. This activity was especially well-received by the kids.
                    
                    I'm happy to report that the camps I was involved in consistently received positive feedback, showcasing the campers' sustained interest and engagement throughout the weeks.                    
                </p>
                <h3>Goal 3: Problem-Solving in STEM Education</h3>
                <p>
                    Having to solve problems was a huge part of my position at engineering outreach. This took its form in many different ways, through developing activities that were engaging and solving issues as they came up in my workshops and camps. 

Creating engaging activities required me to learn and practice problem-solving strategies, such as the engineering design process which includes brainstorming, designing and testing solutions.

I also had to solve problems they came up with on the spot. If a presentation was not working, we were missing material or I had to find a way to better engage the class or a student, I had to learn to act effectively, quickly and confidently.

As my work term progressed, my problem-solving improved, and through feedback I learned how to create more engaging activities so the workshop and camps ran more smoothly.
