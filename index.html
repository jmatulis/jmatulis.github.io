            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>My primary role encompassed the development and delivery of interactive STEM presentations and activities for children. Collaborating with teachers and administrators,
                 I ensured alignment with curriculum goals and educational standards. One of the highlights was designing a module on [Specific Topic, e.g., "Basic Robotics"], which 
                 catered to young learners, invoking curiosity and wonder. While my coursework provided foundational knowledge, the nuances of crafting age-appropriate content and handling 
                 real-time classroom dynamics were skills I honed on the job.</p>
            <h4>May and June</h4>
            <p>During my first two months I aided the Mobile Design Lab team, going into schools across the durham region and presenting and running STEM workshops
                to students aged 4-14. I also helped with the development of new workshops and activities for the upcoming school year. During this time I also developed summer camps for the summer which
                I would be running in July and August. This required me to develop a curriculum for each camp and create a schedule for each week.
