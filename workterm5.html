                    The Co-operators, is an insurance and financial services co-operative headquartered in Guelph. I worked as an Associate Provisioning Specialist on the Provisioning and Programming Team. My role involved building, troubleshooting, and deploying various hardware and software, managing the lifecycle of end-user devices, and contributing to the development of the internal website, called CoopDeploy, to support departmental operations.

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <h3>I decided to persue my goals from my previous semester with The Cooperators further. </h3>
                <h3>Critical & Creative Thinking – Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>One of my primary goals was to improve and utilize my problem solving skills. I gained hands-on experience with Windows 11 devices, and virtual desktops. I built confidence in my ability to troubleshoot, configure, and deploy technology in a fast-paced and structured environment.</p>
    
                <h3>Professional & Ethical Behaviour – Personal Organization</h3>
                <p>I focused on enhancing time management and accountability by prioritizing tasks, meeting deadlines, and maintaining clear 
                    communication with my team. My supervisor noted my reliability and consitency in meeting deadlines. 
                    In my coming workterm I will work on improving documentation when completing builds and refurbishments, to improve clarity and continuity with my other team members.</p>
    
                <h3>Technological Literacy – Full-Stack Development</h3>
                <p>In addition to provisioning, I worked on improving the internal asset tracking website built with React and Node.js. My goal was to improve the quality-of-life of a Provisioning Specialist using CoopDeploy. 
                    I refined my web-development skills by adding new UI components, and 
                    implementing a model mismatch check feature to improve asset tracking and consistency.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <h3>Daily Operations</h3>
                <p>My day-to-day work primarily involved provisioning and deprovisioning physical laptops and virtual machines for new hires, hardware replacements, and internal team transitions. I processed returned laptops, performed quality checks, and ensured devices were compliant with internal policies before redeployment. I also remotely installed applications, configured user accounts, and assisted users with setup through remote desktop support.</p>
    
                <h3>Ticket Queue Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managed a technical support queue for software and hardware requests across the organization.</li>
                    <li>Provisioned laptops with department-specific configurations and ensured compliance with technical standards.</li>
                    <li>Performed troubleshooting for failed software installs and hardware issues, escalating as necessary.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Hardware & Lifecycle Support</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performed basic hardware repairs (e.g., motherboard, screen, battery swaps) and refurbishments for reuse.</li>
                    <li>Participated in inventory tracking and device lifecycle management from acquisition to retirement.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Web Development Project</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved the internal React-based website used for tracking hardware builds, returns, and inventory.</li>
                    <li>Connected frontend updates to backend Node.js endpoints and worked with SQL databases.</li>
                    <li>Added a model mismatch check feature that insured returns and build computers are being stored as the correct model, improving consistency and asset tracking.</li>
                    <li>Currently, I am working on a automatic return process feature which will automate the return process procedures. This includes a new UI modal connected to the backend via API calls. </li>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This work term at The Co-operators allowed me to bridge my academic learning with real-world IT operations. I developed practical knowledge of enterprise provisioning, software deployment, and technical support while contributing meaningfully to internal tooling through web development. This role sharpened my ability to work under pressure, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and deliver technology that supports a growing workforce. I look forward to applying these experiences in future terms and long-term career development.</p>
