                <p>This work term at The Co-operators allowed me to bridge my academic learning with real-world IT operations. I developed practical knowledge of enterprise provisioning, software deployment, and technical support while contributing meaningfully to internal tooling through web development. This role sharpened my ability to work under pressure, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and deliver technology that supports a growing workforce. I look forward to applying these experiences in future terms and long-term career development.</p>
